## Introduction

Hello! 

I'm glad you could make your way to my little section of the world. My name is Joe and here is where I'll be writing about my journeys with tech and potentially other random nerd bits at times.

Come with me as I debug things that are causing me problems. Try spinning up new technologies, and really, any other thing that causes me to scratch my head.

Here's to a good journey! Try to keep up.


*The metal slime runs away!*
